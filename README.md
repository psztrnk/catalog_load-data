# catalog_load-data
Load test data to your [Catalog](https://github.com/psztrnk/catalog) install.

## How to
1. Add the `load` directory to the root of your Catalog install.
2. Visit `[yourcatalog]/load/load.php` in your browser.

catalog_load-data will try to add 10000 (ten thousand) random records to your Catalog's database, or will run until maximum execution time (if any) is exceeded.
